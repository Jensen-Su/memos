my '\boot' is mounted to sda5 and '\' to sda6:

.Boot the liveCD (usb ubuntu)
.sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt
.sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda
.sudo reboot

Note: before reboot, some people would suggest you 'sudo update-grub'.
    This incured a problem here:
        'error: failed to get cannonical path of /cow',
    which I failed to solve after plenty of efforts. 
    Then I discarded this line, and it just worked around.

The system sucessfully boots, but grub still have some problem.

After 'sudo apt-get upgrade', the grub boot guide just came back.
