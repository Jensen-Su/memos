The problem seems to be casued by some weird nvidia driver installed by 'sudo apt-get upgrade'

Just doing 'sudo apt-get purge nvidia*; sudo apt-get autoremove'.

Update.

The problem is actually due to a wrong driver installed.

To install the correct driver, firstly purge nvidia*, then:

## to find out the model of your graphics card:
    $ lspci -vnn | grep -i VGA -A 12

## find out the right driver version for your graphics card:
    curl: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx

## Setup the xorg-edgers ppa
    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa -y
    $ apt-get update

## Intall the driver

    # the version for this machine is 367.57
    $s sudo apt-get install nvidia-367

NOTE: Never 'sudo apt-get install nvidia-current', which installed a 304 version for me, and caused rightly the problem.


Installing the right GPU driver also solved the 'built-in display' problem for me.
